### Why did I build this
The Medisana API is death! It wasn't very good...but somewhat usable. But now it's really gone! But I wanted my data. Not stupid excel / csv output... but json api like output. 
Luckily for me... their own website still uses a kind of api json output. With this little piece of code you can get that data and it puts it in a usable json file.

just create a config.yml file (take the sample as example) put in your medisana website credentials and:

`python medisana.py`

You can also get some graphics if you like by 

`python graphs.py`

### Build status
