## My name is Theo van der Sluijs.

I am a passionate professional who likes to look at software development and IT from different perspectives. With more than 20+ years of experience as a software developer and IT, 10+ years as an architect and 8+ years as a consultant, I’ve coupled my technical expertise, management skills and agile practices to help company’s and become hyper-productive.

With 8+ years of Scrum Master experience, 3+ years of Product Owner experience, I know how to create value in complex environments by finding ways to create improvement and strengthen the collaboration between business and IT.

I help Software Engineers and Dev/Ops with enthusiasm and by knowing the content and details of the project so I can layout a roadmap with a balance in long term quality and short term delivery.

As an Agile Coach I help departments and companies with their Agile transformations. With over 8+ years as a Scrum Master, 3+ years as a Product Owner and 5+ years of leading Agile transformations I know all the pitfalls and how to overcome them.

More than once I’ve been called a very enthusiastic, proactive, skilled, analytic team player and coach as I enjoy training, coaching and motivating people till the end of each project.

Bringing the ability to quickly know why a project is running as it is (good or bad), I’m always driven how to (further) improve this.
